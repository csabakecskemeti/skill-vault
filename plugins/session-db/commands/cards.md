Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cards-ctl.sh $ARGUMENTS` (use `status` when no
arguments were given) and report its output verbatim in a couple of lines.

Pass arguments through unchanged. Put single quotes around any argument containing `${`,
so a URL like `${SPARK_BASE_URL_LAN}/v1` is stored as written and expanded at call time.

`now` and `test` call the configured model and can take a minute or more on a long session.

If the arguments contain an API key (`key ...`), do not repeat the key in your reply.

Do not explain the plugin, do not suggest follow-up commands, and do not run anything else.
